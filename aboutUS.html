<font size="3" color="white" face="jokerman">For years, we traveled and joined multiple clubs, but couldn't find the one that fit all of our needs. What we kept seeing were fitness clubs that didn't have enough equipment so we would wait 
    in lines to use the machines or gyms where the variety of equipment was too scarce. To top it off the whole service aspect of the gyms would always feel like an afterthought and as a member, 
    we felt neglected and forgotten about. This is what lead us to create Impact Fitness and bring service back to the gym and remind members how a gym should be. Our ambitions were fueled with 
    solutions to all the faults we saw in many clubs and decided to make a club that made sense and treated it's members with the utmost respect while delivering the highest quality of service. 
                                   Here at Impact Fitness, that is exactly what you will find, come see how we are bringing service back to the gym and how a real gym should be!</font>
